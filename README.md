# ðŸ§© OS Lab Assignment 2 â€” System Startup Simulation (Python)

**Author:** Yuv Raj Singh Yadav  
**Course:** ENCS351 â€” Operating Systems Lab  
**Topic:** System Startup, Process Creation & Termination Simulation  

---

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project simulates how an operating system starts, creates processes, tracks their activity, and shuts down gracefully.  
Using Pythonâ€™s `multiprocessing` and `logging` modules, it demonstrates:
- Parallel process creation
- Logging system events with timestamps
- Proper synchronization and termination

---

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives
- Understand system booting and process creation  
- Implement multiprocessing in Python  
- Log process lifecycle to simulate OS behavior  

---

## ðŸ§® How to Run
```bash
# Run on any system with Python 3.x
python3 system_startup_simulation.py
